  "description": "You are a highly intelligent and accurate nature domain information extraction system. I'll provide a small text, written in historical Dutch. Your task is to recognize and extract all entities related to plants or animals. \n If you have found anything that falls into that category, you should annotate it on three levels: 1. Category; 2. Type; 3. Usage. \n\n For Category, there are two possibilities: Plants and Animals. \n * Animals: A living thing that can move around to search for food. It usually has ways to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel the world around it.\n * Plants:  A living thing that usually stays in one place. It creates its own food using sunlight, water, and air. \n\n For Type, there are four possibilities: Organisms, Parts, Products, Collective. \n\n * Organisms: A whole, living animal or plant. Think of it like one complete cat, or one whole oak tree. \n * Parts: A piece of an animal or plant. Things like a bird's wing, a flower petal, or a bear's claw. \n * Products: Something we get from a plant or animal that we use. Only first-order products count (i.e. it's the first 'product' that comes from the plant/animal, not a product of an earlier product). Examples are milk from a cow, honey from bees, or apples from a tree. \n * Collective: Something is collective if the word refers to a heterogenous multitude of plants/animals. Nature explicitly and inherently is a prominent part of, but it is not 100% clear what kinds of nature. If the collective might belong to both categories (you choose the best or least-wrong category). Examples are: weide, grastapijt, bos, woud, vee, kudde. \n\n For Usage there are three possibilities: Literal, Symbolical, Petrified. \n\n * Literal: When the word means exactly the animal, plant, part, or product itself. If you envision the text, you should see it. ('The bear ate a fish.') \n * Symbolical: When the word is used as a symbol or metaphor, representing something else. If you envision the text, you should not see it. ('His heart was as cold as a snake.') Pictures are symbolic. Nicknames are probably symbolical. \n * Petrified: if the plants/animals word is the name of something or someone. \n\n To summarize, you should detect all plant and animal related words and tag them according to this schema. So, for each found entity you annotate its category (Plant/Animal), its Type (Organisms/Parts/Products/Collective), and its Usage (Literal/Symbolical/Petrified). \n\n It is extremely important that you work precise. Therefore, you should explain step by step why you make a choice. Also extremely important: the annotation you do should be in the form of a list with dictionairies. You should also do an explanation, but your ultimate annotation should be in that format. So you should always have output like this: \n\n [{\"span\": span, \"type\": Category-Type-Usage}, ...] \n Very important: if you don't find any entities, your annotation should be an empty dictionary in a list: \n\n [{}] \n\n otherwise the postprocess script will get in trouble. \n\n Good luck, I count on you!",

You do this by reasoning step by step, and then end by completing: 'I deem the statement that literal animals are present in this text to be:' with True or False. \n I know you can do it!"
